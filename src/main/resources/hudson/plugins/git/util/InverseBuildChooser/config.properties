blurb=Build all branches <b>except</b> for those which match the branch specifiers configure above. \
  This is useful, for example, when you have jobs building your <tt>master</tt> and various \
  <tt>release</tt> branches and you want a second job which builds all new feature branches &mdash; \
  i.e. branches which do not match these patterns &mdash; without redundantly building \
  <tt>master</tt> and the release branches again each time they change.
